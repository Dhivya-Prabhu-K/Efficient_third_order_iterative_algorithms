# Efficient_third_order_iterative_algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains **MATLAB codes** for the numerical comparison of four iterative algorithms used to compute the zeros of special functions.

The comparisons are performed for:
- Bessel functions  
- Cylinder functions  
- Hermite polynomials  
- Legendre polynomials

## Repository Contents

### 1. CPU_time_comparison
MATLAB codes to compare the **average CPU run time** of the iterative algorithms for computing zeros of the above functions.

### 2. Error_comparison
MATLAB codes to compare the **numerical errors** produced by the algorithms when computing zeros.

### 3. Table_comparison
MATLAB codes to generate tables summarizing:
- Total number of iterations  
- Average CPU time  

for each algorithm and test problem.
